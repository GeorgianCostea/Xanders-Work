Notes:

    The options can be in any order and might or might not be present.
    Each option must have its own "-" preceding it (e.g. it is not permissible to have -sw).
    There might or might not be a space between the -w and the specified width.
    A '\n' character is actually a carriage return character (ASCII value 0x0d) followed by a line feed character (ASCII value 0x0a).
    Files do not necessarily end with a '\n'.
        The reason for this is that some editing programs put the '\n' at the end and some do not
    If width is anything other than a positive integer less than 65535, display a usage error message.
    You will likely get a better mark if you use Baby Steps to design this program.
    This is NOT a group project. It must be done individually.

Errors:

    Displays a "File not openable" error message and terminates without any other further output if any of the files cannot be opened.
        If this happens on a second or subsequent file, it is OK to process the previous files that can be opened.
    Displays a "Usage: wrapfile [-s] [-w width] file ..." error message and terminates if the command line options are incorrect.
        Your error message must look exactly as stated above.
    Displays an appropriate error message and terminates without any other further output if there is a error with reading or closing any of the files.

Exit Status:
0 	successful
1 	can't open file
2 	command line options incorrect
3 	any other fatal errors

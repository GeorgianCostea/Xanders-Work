The following code is a custom webserver created just because i wanted to have a better undestading of the HTTP protocol 

The web server will be able to display *.jpg *.png  parse HTML & PHP code and also parse a special format file *.ssp which includes html code and basic arithmetic.


the webserver needs to be installed on the computer as a service. ( check out webserverSetup folder) 

Once the service is installed just execute the webServer.exe and point to the correct folder.
